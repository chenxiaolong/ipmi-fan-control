# Method of aggregating the temperatures from all of the sources. By default,

# List of steps for mapping temperatures to duty cycles. The temperatures are
# in degrees Celsius and the PWM duty cycles are fan speed percentages. At 0%
# duty cycle, the fans are completely turned off and at 100% duty cycle, the
# fans are at the maximum speed. Be careful using low percentages as the fans
# may stall.
#
# The algorithm follows the rules below:
#
# * If the current temperature is lower than the first step's `temp`, then the
#   first step's `dcycle` is used.
# * If the current temperature is higher than the last step's `temp`, then the
#   last step's `dcycle` is used.
# * If there are no steps, then the duty cycle is set to 100%.
# * Otherwise, the duty cycle is linearly scaled between the step below the
#   current temperature and the step above the current temperature.
#
# Note that these rules mean that having a single step will result in a fixed
# fan speed. Also, the list must be sorted, `temp` must be strictly increasing,
# and `dcycle` must be increasing.
